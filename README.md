In this repository, I solve the dollar words problem using a C# console application. Unit tests are also added to the project. 

For those of you who don't know the dollar words problem - 

Dollar Words:
 
The input file american-words.txt is attached.

Using a C# console application, give each letter in each word a numerical value equal to its position in the alphabet.  So "a" is 1 and "z" is 26.  Punctuation and whitespace is 0.  Find words where the sum of the value of the letters is 100 and print each of the “100” words on the console.
